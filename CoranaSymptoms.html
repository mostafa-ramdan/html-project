<h3> What are the symptoms of COVID-19? </h3>
COVID-19 symptoms can be very mild to severe. Some people have no symptoms. The most common symptoms are fever, cough and tiredness.

Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, muscle aches, chills, sore throat, headache, chest pain, and loss of taste or smell. This list is not all inclusive. Other less common symptoms have also been reported. Symptoms may appear two to 14 days after exposure.
<h4> Can COVID-19 be prevented? </h4>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given emergency use authorization to some COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. A vaccine might prevent you from getting COVID-19 or prevent you from becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 if you get the COVID-19 virus.
