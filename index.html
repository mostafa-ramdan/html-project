<h3> What is COVID 19 ? </h3>

A new virus called the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that began in China in 2019. The disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Public health groups, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO, are monitoring the pandemic and posting updates on their websites. These groups have also issued recommendations for preventing the spread of the virus.

How does the coronavirus spread?
Data has shown that the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mainly spreads from person to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone infected with the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby.
Sometimes the COVID-19 virus can spread when a person is exposed to small droplets that stay in the air for several minutes or hours — called airborne transmission. It's not yet known how common it is for the virus to spread this way.

It can also spread if a person touches a surface with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes, but this isn't a main way it spreads.

<h4> Can I travel? </h4> 
If you're planning to travel, first check for travel advisories and use appropriate precautions when in public. You also may want to talk with your doctor if you have health conditions that make you more susceptible to respiratory infections and complications.

<h5> What can I do if I am or may be ill with COVID-19? </h5>
If you develop symptoms or you've been exposed to the COVID-19 virus, contact your doctor for medical advice. If you need to go to the doctor or hospital, call ahead so health care providers can take steps to ensure that others aren't exposed.

Take the following precautions to avoid spreading the COVID-19 virus:
•Stay home from work, school and public areas, except to get medical care.
•Avoid public transportation, taxis and ride-sharing if possible.
•Wear a cloth face mask around other people.
•Isolate yourself as much as possible from others in your home.
•Use a separate bedroom and bathroom if possible.
•Avoid sharing dishes, glasses, bedding and other household items.
